      A prominent measure of air quality is done using different micron diameters of Particulate Matter. The main subset we will be focusing on will be Particulate Matter of
      a size lesser than 2.5 microns.

      "For PM2.5, short-term exposures (up to 24-hours duration) have been associated with premature mortality, increased hospital admissions for heart or lung causes, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, emergency room visits, respiratory symptoms, and restricted activity days. These adverse health effects have been reported primarily in infants, children, and older adults with preexisting heart or lung diseases. In addition, of all of the common air pollutants, PM2.5 is associated with the greatest proportion of adverse health effects related to air pollution, both in the United States and world-wide based on the World Health Organizationâ€™s Global Burden of Disease Project." -<a href=https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health>California Air Resources Board</a>

    <p><b>My hypothesis is that Administrative Divisions responsible for the highest shares of GDP will be responsible for the greatest amount of pollution in the country.

    The graphs below display the data from a <a href=https://weijing-rs.github.io/product.html>Github IO Page by Jing Wei</a> which provides Zenodo (netCDF) datasets that I used. Additionally, 
      the data regarding GDP was found from this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China>Wikipedia</a> page and the dataset for the Xinjiang province visualization came from <a href=https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/map/?>the Xinjiang Data Project</a>.
